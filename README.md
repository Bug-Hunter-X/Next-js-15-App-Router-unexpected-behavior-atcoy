# Next.js 15 App Router Unexpected Behavior

This repository demonstrates an unexpected behavior encountered in a Next.js 15 App Router application.  A simple component renders unexpectedly, potentially related to how the App Router handles component hydration or routing.

## Bug Report

The issue occurs when using a basic component.  The component renders, but not as expected, highlighting a potential issue with either rendering behavior or client-side hydration within the new Next.js 15 architecture.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Observe the unexpected behavior in the browser.

## Expected Behavior

The component should render correctly, displaying 'Hello world'.

## Actual Behavior

The component may render unexpectedly,  possibly blank or displaying unexpected content.

## Possible Causes

* Incorrect routing configuration within the App Router.
* Issues related to component hydration or data fetching.
* Unforeseen interaction with other aspects of the Next.js 15 framework.

## Proposed Solution (if applicable)

The solution file includes a modification that addresses the unexpected behavior.  This may involve a change in how the component is structured, how data is fetched and managed, or a correction to the routing configuration.
